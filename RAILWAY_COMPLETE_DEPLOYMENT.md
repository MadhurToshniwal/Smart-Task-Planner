# ðŸš€ Complete Railway Deployment Guide - Smart Task Planner

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites
- GitHub account (already done âœ…)
- Railway account (we'll create this)
- Groq API key (for AI features)

## ðŸŽ¯ Step-by-Step Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Create Railway Account
1. Go to **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Sign up with your **GitHub account** (recommended)
4. Verify your email if prompted

### Step 2: Create New Project from GitHub
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose **"MadhurToshniwal/Smart-Task-Planner"**
4. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js project

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. In your Railway project dashboard, click on your service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Add these environment variables:

```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/smart-task-planner
```

**Important:** Replace `gsk_your_actual_groq_api_key_here` with your actual Groq API key!

### Step 4: Add MongoDB Database
1. In Railway dashboard, click **"New"** â†’ **"Database"** â†’ **"Add MongoDB"**
2. Railway will provision a free MongoDB instance
3. Once created, click on the MongoDB service
4. Go to **"Connect"** tab
5. Copy the **"Private URL"** (starts with `mongodb://`)
6. Go back to your main service â†’ **"Variables"**
7. Update `MONGO_URI` with the copied MongoDB URL

### Step 5: Deploy the Application
1. Railway automatically builds and deploys when you push to GitHub
2. Wait for the build to complete (check **"Deployments"** tab)
3. Once deployed, you'll see a green checkmark âœ…

### Step 6: Get Your Live URL
1. In your service dashboard, go to **"Settings"**
2. Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. Railway will give you a free `.railway.app` URL
4. Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Build Fails
**Solution:** Check that your `package.json` has the correct start script:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

### Issue 2: MongoDB Connection Error
**Solution:** 
1. Ensure MongoDB service is running in Railway
2. Double-check the `MONGO_URI` environment variable
3. Make sure you're using the **Private URL** from Railway MongoDB

### Issue 3: Groq API Not Working
**Solution:**
1. Verify your Groq API key is correct
2. Check you have credits/usage available
3. Test the API key locally first

### Issue 4: Frontend Not Loading
**Solution:**
The app serves React from the backend. Ensure your `server.js` includes:
```javascript
// Serve static files from React build
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/build')));

// Catch-all handler for React routes
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '../frontend/build', 'index.html'));
});
```

## ðŸ”¥ Quick Deployment Commands (Alternative Method)

If you prefer using Railway CLI:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results After Deployment

### âœ… What Should Work:
1. **Homepage** loads with Material-UI interface
2. **Add Goal** functionality works
3. **AI Task Generation** creates intelligent subtasks
4. **Task Management** (mark complete, edit, delete)
5. **Progress Analytics** with charts
6. **Responsive Design** on mobile/desktop

### ðŸ§ª Testing Your Deployed App:
1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Click **"Add Goal"**
3. Enter: "Learn React Development"
4. Click **"Generate AI Tasks"**
5. Verify AI creates relevant subtasks
6. Mark some tasks as complete
7. Check the analytics dashboard

## ðŸŽ¯ Free Tier Limits
- **Railway Free Tier:**
  - $5 free credits per month
  - Enough for development and demo purposes
  - Auto-sleeps after inactivity (wakes up quickly)

## ðŸ”’ Security Notes
- Environment variables are encrypted in Railway
- Never commit real API keys to GitHub
- Use the `.env.example` file for reference

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?
If deployment fails:
1. Check Railway **"Logs"** tab for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Ensure MongoDB service is running
4. Check GitHub repository has latest code

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Indicators
Your deployment is successful when:
- âœ… Build completes without errors
- âœ… Railway shows "Deployed" status
- âœ… Your URL loads the React frontend
- âœ… AI task generation works
- âœ… Database operations function properly
